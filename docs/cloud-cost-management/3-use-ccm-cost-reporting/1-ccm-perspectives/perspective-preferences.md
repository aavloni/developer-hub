With perspective preferences, you have the flexibility to tailor the cost data presented in your perspective. You can opt to include or exclude specific cost data provided by the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) according to your needs and preferences. By including all cost data, any discrepancies between the CSP dashboards and harness Perspectives can be avoided, ensuring accurate and comprehensive cost analysis.
