## Deprecation notice

The following deprecated API endpoints will no longer be supported:
- [GET | PUT | POST | DELETE] api/resourcegroup/{identifier}
- POST api/resourcegroup/filter
- GET api/resourcegroup

## Latest: Version 80811

### New features and enhancements

- Access control lists (ACLs) have now been optimized by the removal of ACLs that are no longer necessary and by ensuring that redundant ACLs are no longer created for new role assignments. (PL-41154)

- The default interval for synchronizing LDAP groups has been increased from 15 minutes to 1 hour. This value is customizable, so you can set it to a value of your choice. This change does not affect existing LDAP configurations. (PL-40860)

- The **Assign Roles** dialog listed the built-in Account Viewer role when you were assigning roles to a user group, and it did not provide a way for you to remove that role. You could, however, remove the Account Viewer role when updating the role assignments in the **Manage Role Bindings** dialog. (PL-32413)

  This issue has been fixed. You can now remove the Account Viewer role when assigning roles to a user group. 

- The Roles page now supports a list view in addition to the existing card view. In addition to the information shown in the card view, the list view shows you which resources are selected for the role. To see the list view, in the top-right corner of the Roles page, select the list view button. (PL-32183)

- You can now reference secret values in JSON files by using XPATH. Support is available for AWS Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager, and HashiCorp Vault. (PL-41063)

   This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

- The password field in the SMTP configuration wizard showed asterisks, which are typically used to mask passwords, even when the SMTP configuration did not use a password. This issue caused confusion about whether a password was in fact in use. (PL-41159)

  This issue has been fixed. If the SMTP configuration does not use a password, the password field does not show asterisks.

- In the connector configuration wizard, if you selected Azure Key Vault or GCP Secret Manager and then selected the **Use the credentials of a specific Harness Delegate (IAM role, service account, etc)** option, the wizard did not show the **Use as Default Secret Manager** checkbox. You could, however, achieve this configuration through the Harness API. (PL-41054)

  This issue has been fixed. 

- API requests for creating and updating projects (`POST v1/orgs/{org}/projects` and `POST v1/orgs/{org}/projects/{project}`, respectively) were considered invalid if you specified a value for the `org` parameter both in the body of the request and in the URL path, and the two values did not match. In this scenario, the following message was displayed: `Invalid request: Request is having different org in payload and param` (PL-40668)

  This issue has been fixed by the removal of the parameter from the request body schema. You are now required to provide this parameter only in the URL path.

- When steps timed out for aborted tasks that were previously assigned, the UI displayed an incorrect error message. (PL-41226, ZD-49908, ZD-50652)
   
  The UI now displays the correct error message.
  
  This item is available with Harness Platform version 80811 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- Harness Platform release 80504 did not allow you to create empty user groups. (PL-41005, ZD-50411, ZD-50475)

  This issue has been fixed.

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

- Harness showed JSON Web Token URLs in Delegate task logs associated with shell script task failures. (PL-39102)

  This issue has been fixed.

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

- Harness did not handle the `Unknown Host Exception` error appropriately and, consequently, showed the misleading "Delegates are not available for performing operation" message when you configured LDAP incorrectly (for example, you entered an incorrect host or port number). (PL-28077)

  This issue has been fixed.

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

- The UI allowed all users to select the **Copy token** option from the **More Options** (&vellip;) menu. (PL-41155)
  
  This issue has been resolved. Now, only users with the required permissions to copy tokens are able to select the **Copy token** option.

  This item is available with Harness Platform version 80811 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- Upgraded the Bouncy Castle library to address potential vulnerabilities. (PL-40729, ZD-48823)
  - `org.bouncycastle:bcpg-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcpg-jdk18on:jar:1.76`
  - `org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk18on:jar:1.76`
  - `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk18on:jar:1.76`
  - `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:jar:1.76`

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- Delegates failed to reauthenticate with the proxy after the initial proxy session expired. (PL-40630, ZD-48981, ZD-49626)
  
  The following updates to delegate communication with Harness Manager over proxy resolve this issue.
  - Removed `return null` when the delegate receives the required 407 proxy authentication.
  - Added the following variables for the `asyncHttpClient` to authenticate with the proxy.
    - `org.asynchttpclient.AsyncHttpClientConfig.proxy.user`
    - `org.asynchttpclient.AsyncHttpClientConfig.proxy.password`

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

## Previous releases

<details>
<summary>2023 releases</summary>

#### Version 80711

##### New features and enhancements

-  The delegate Helm chart is now included in the delegate proxy configuration. You can pull the Helm chart from `https://<YOUR_LOADBALANCER_URL>/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/`. (PL-39190)

- The heartbeat interval that perpetual tasks use to test connectors has been increased from 10 minutes to 30 minutes. This change aims to reduce the number of errors logged due to failed heartbeats. The new heartbeat interval is used with any connectors that you create after this deployment. Tasks associated with existing connectors require migration to the new interval. Harness will migrate such perpetual tasks in all accounts in a phased manner. This activity does not require any action from you or other users of the platform. (PL-39399)

- To enhance security, Harness has added settings to enable and disable Slack, Microsoft Teams, webhook, and PagerDuty notification channels at the account scope. (PL-39921)

  For more information, go to [Notification settings](/docs/platform/notifications/notification-settings).

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- Earlier, you could only see a maximum of three tags on the Delegates list page. (PL-38936)

   This issue has been fixed. You can now see all the tags for all delegates.

- The Harness UI fetched only the first 200 organizations when you performed a search for an organization in the **Create Project** dialog (the page size for the API request is 200). If an organization you wanted to specify was not part of this initial set of organizations, the Harness UI did not generate additional API requests, and you were blocked on creating your project. (PL-39198)

  This issue has been fixed. You can now search for and select any organization in your account.

- Updates to the role assignments of a user group in one project caused role assignments to get updated in other projects in the organization. The issue was observed in the following scenario:
    - You used a regex query to update role assignments in a project.
    - Identifiers of other projects in the organization overlapped with that of the project in which you updated role assignments. 
    - Identifiers of user groups in those other projects matched the identifier of the user group you updated. (PL-39780, ZD-46314)

- When Harness is configured to use the AppRole ID to fetch an authentication token from HashiCorp Vault, Harness generates a large number of requests for those tokens. The volume of requests causes performance issues. (PL-40754)

  This issue has been fixed. You can now specify whether or not you want to retain the token to reduce the number of requests made. Possible values are `True` and `False`. The default value is `True`.

- If there are no delegate configurations to show on the **Delegate Configurations** tab of your project's **Delegates** page, the Harness UI hides the tab. Any errors associated with retrieving data for that tab are, therefore, also invisible to users. This behavior is expected and by design. However, after the deployment of Harness NextGen UI version 0.356.18, this behavior changed: if there were no delegate configurations to show and the associated API request resulted in an error, the associated error message was displayed on the other two tabs of the project's **Delegates** page, namely, the **Delegates** and **Tokens** tabs.

  For example, if you were not authorized to view delegate configurations, and if there were no delegate configurations to show on the **Delegate Configurations** tab, Harness would display the error `You are not authorized to view delegate configurations. You are missing the following permission: View delegate configurations ...` on the **Delegates** and **Tokens** tabs. (PL-40757, ZD-49023)

  This issue has been fixed.

- The **Create or Select an Existing Connector** dialog did not show any results when you filtered on Nexus connectors. (PL-40904)
  
  The associated API is now fixed.

- Emails inviting users to a Harness project included a stack trace. The issue was limited to users who had single sign-on enabled on their accounts. (PL-40991, ZD-50038)

  This issue has been fixed.

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.
  
#### Version 80504

##### New features and enhancements

- When Harness is configured to use the AppRole ID to fetch an authentication token from HashiCorp Vault, Harness generates a large number of requests for those tokens. The volume of requests causes performance issues. (PL-40754)

  This issue has been fixed. You can now specify whether or not you want to retain the token to reduce the number of requests made. Possible values are `True` and `False`. The default value is `True`.

- Go has been upgraded from version 1.20.5 to version 1.21.0. This upgrade remediates CVE-2023-39533. (PL-40734)

- You are now required to sign an end-user license agreement to access the Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA) in the account and project scopes. (PL-39723)

  The EULA is displayed when you enable AIDA at the account scope (**Account Settings** > **Account Resources** > **Default Settings** > **Harness AI Developer Assistant**).

  Each account user must sign the EULA only once.

  The setting is inherited at the project scope.

- The delegate expiration policy has been extended from 3 months to 6 months. You now only have to update delegates once every 6 months. (PL-39452)

   This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80505. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

- The OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer version is upgraded to 20220608.1. (PL-40807)

- The Mozilla Rhino library has been upgraded from version 1.7R4 to 1.7.14. (PL-40808)

- The Spring Boot library is upgraded to version 2.7.14. (PL-40810)

- If the Email step failed to send a notification, the following message was displayed: “Failed to send the email. Check SMTP configuration.” The message did not include any additional information to help you debug the issue. (PL-40007, ZD-47524)

   Now, the message has been enhanced to show the cause of failure. It also identifies the delegate that executed the task.
   
   This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80505. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- The **Create or Select an Existing Connector** dialog did not show any results when you filtered on Nexus connectors. (PL-40904)
  
  The associated API is now fixed.

- Fixed an issue where the `ACCOUNT_SECRET` environment variable was overriding the `DELEGATE_TOKEN` value in the delegate's Docker container for delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`). (PL-40728)

- The count of failed streams on the **Failed Streaming** card (on the **Account Audit Trail** page) continued to include problematic destinations even after those destinations were removed. (PL-40641, ZD-49004)

  This issue is now fixed. The error count includes only available destinations. 

- A role that you created would not appear when you typed its name on the **Manage Role Bindings** page. Therefore, you could not use the Harness application to bind that role to a user group. The issue was caused by the role assignment API retrieving only the first 100 roles in the ascending order (the page size is 100), and the associated client-side search being limited to those 100 roles. If the role you wanted was not part of this initial set of roles, it did not appear in your search. (PL-40363, ZD-48229)
  
  This issue is now fixed. A newly introduced server-side search includes roles that are beyond the page size limit.

- If the renewal of a HashiCorp Vault token that is used for token-based authentication fails, Harness attempts to renew the token perpetually. These attempts load the system and seem amplified in scenarios in which the connector or service is no longer in use. (PL-32647)
  
  To handle such scenarios better, Harness now pauses its attempts to renew a token if two consecutive renewal attempts fail. Harness resumes its renewal attempts when you perform one of the following tasks:
    - You update the associated HashiCorp Vault connector.
    - You test the associated HashiCorp Vault connector manually and the test succeeds.

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

#### Version 80406

##### New features and enhancements

- Earlier, in the audit trail, all changes to a user principal's role assignment were logged with the generic Update action type. The record offered no additional information about whether a role assignment was created, updated, or deleted. (PL-39799, ZD-46451)

  Now, role assignment changes are logged with one of the following, more informative action types:
    - Role Assignment Created
    - Role Assignment Updated
    - Role Assignment Deleted

- Earlier, in delegate selection logs, the non-selected error message included all mismatched selectors.

   Now, the non-selected error message includes only selectors mismatched within the scope. (PL-40651)

- You can now create secrets in child scopes using the parent scope in Secret Manager. For example, you can create secrets inside a project using the Secret Manager created at the Org or Account level. (PL-38949)

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- In some scenarios, when the delegate tried to send a heartbeat to connect to Harness Manager and MongoDB was down, Harness Manager sent a self_destruct message to stop the delegate. (PL-38122)

  This issue is fixed. Harness Manager no longer sends `self_destruct messages`, the delegate continues to run, and the delegate tries to send a heartbeat again after one minute.

- The Harness user interface did not give you the option to view more than ten resources in a resource group. (PL-40747, ZD-49413)

  This issue is now fixed.

- With an earlier update, delegates tried to create a Kubernetes runner, which created an API client using the Kubernetes config. Shell delegates tried to fetch the local config. GKE configurations with expired credentials resulted in an error. (PL-40631)

  This issue is fixed. Harness catches the exception and continues with delegate startup.

- A few minutes after you linked a Harness user group to a different LDAP group, the change was reverted. That is, the user group gets linked to the previous LDAP group. The behavior persisted even if you deleted the user group, created a new user group with the same name, and then associated it with the second LDAP group. (PL-40558, ZD-48332)

  This issue is now fixed.

- When adding users to a user group, you had to manually select users from the menu; pasting email addresses in the text box did not work. (PL-40559)

  Now, in addition to selecting users from the menu, you can paste users' email addresses in the text box.

- Earlier, when you clicked an expired link in an invitation email, Harness displayed the following message: “We couldn’t find an invitation matching the email address you entered. Please search your email for an invitation from Harness or contact your admin." This message was inaccurate. (PL-40597)

  Now, Harness displays the following message when you click a link in an expired invitation: "This invitation URL has expired. Please request for a new invitation from your admin."

- If the Email step failed to send a notification, the following message was displayed: “Failed to send the email. Check SMTP configuration.” The message did not include any additional information to help you debug the issue. (PL-40007, ZD-47524)

  Now, the message has been enhanced to show the cause of failure. It also identifies the delegate that executed the task.

- Attempts to use the `harness_platform_user` resource to create or delete users results in an error. The message "Request failed as you have an older version of entity, please reload the page and try again" is displayed and the Terraform state goes out of sync with Harness. (PL-39870, ZD-47107)

  This issue has been fixed. 

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.


#### Version 80307

##### New features and enhancements

- To support MongoDB 5.0, the Debezium library has been upgraded to version 1.9. (PL-40491)

- If you use the App Role authentication method in the Hashicorp Vault connector, you can choose to cache the vault token. The token is cached on the Harness Delegate for a time duration equal to the TTL of the vault token, with 1% leeway. 

  By default, caching is enabled for all existing connectors. To disable caching, go to the connector's YAML configuration and set the `enableCache` parameter to `false`. Harness UI support to enable and disable caching will be added in a subsequent release. (PL-39821)

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.08.80308. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- When you navigated to the Pipelines page, Harness checked for a Continuous Integration license. If you did not have a CI license, you were redirected to the CI Start Trial page because the Pipelines page was once part of the CI module. 

  The issue has been resolved by the removal of such a check from the Pipelines page on the Projects tab. This change also resolves similar issues involving a redirect to Start Trial pages for other Harness modules. (PL-40611, ZD-48952)

- If the number of service instances went down to zero and came back up after a duration of 1 day, they were not displayed on custom dashboards. 

  This issue is resolved, and custom dashboards now show service instances when the count is greater than zero. (CDS-75585, ZD-47848) 

- During a long network outage that impacted the delegate, attempts made by the delegate to reconnect the websocket failed. The issue was caused by the delegate attempting to reconnect the websocket only once, after failing to send five heartbeats in succession. (PL-40547, ZD-48579)

  The issue is now fixed. During long network outages, the delegate attempts to reconnect the websocket every time it fails to send a heartbeat.

    This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.08.80308. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

- Updates to the role assignments of a user group in one project caused role assignments to get updated in other projects in the organization. The issue was observed in the following scenario:
    - You used a regex query to update role assignments in a project.
    - Identifiers of other projects in the organization overlapped with that of the project in which you updated role assignments. 
    - Identifiers of user groups in those other projects matched the identifier of the user group you updated. (PL-39780, ZD-46314)

  The issue is now fixed. 

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

#### August 10, 2023, version 80208

##### What's new

- Accounts with Free and Community licenses are limited to 100 users. (PL-40260)

- The heartbeat interval that perpetual tasks use to test connectors has been increased from 10 minutes to 30 minutes. This change aims to reduce the number of errors logged due to failed heartbeats. The new heartbeat interval is used with any connectors that you create after this deployment. Tasks associated with existing connectors require migration to the new interval. Harness will migrate such perpetual tasks in all accounts in a phased manner. This activity does not require any action from you or other users of the platform. (PL-39399)

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- For the **Audit Trail**, the **YAML Difference** on the **Event Summary** pane didn’t include tag information for delegate groups and registers. (PL-40073)
   
  This issue has been resolved.
   
  This item is available with Harness Platform version 80208 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- When configuring an RBAC resource group in Harness Manager, if you discarded your changes, the resource group page showed a list of resources that should not be available at the scope that you are in. (PL-40393, ZD-48270)

  This issue has been resolved.

- Previously, the **Select a Project** pane displayed duplicate projects. The issue was caused by Harness Manager allowing users to create projects with the same `projectIdentifier` key in different organizations. (PL-40302, ZD-48700)

  The issue has been resolved by the use of a unique key that combines the project and organization identifiers. 

- The Setup Vault step of the Azure Key Vault connector wizard continued to use the previous secret reference even after you changed it. (PL-40269, ZD-48150)

  The issue is now fixed, and the wizard reads the latest value. 

- Harness Manager did not show role assignments for a service account at the organization and project scopes if the parent scope (the account scope and organization scope, respectively) had a service account with the same identifier. (PL-40245, ZD-47906)

  The issue is now fixed, and any affected service accounts will be displayed correctly. 

- Harness API requests for creating an API key for a service account returned an HTTP 200 OK status code even if the API request did not have a valid service account ID. Consequently, the `harness_platform_apikey` resource for Terraform failed to create the API key at the intended scope. The issue was caused by Harness failing to validate the service account identifier. (PL-40243, ZD-47921)

  The issue is fixed, and service account identifiers are now validated.

- The menu for selecting the page size on the account-level Audit Trail page shows the text `Select` by default instead of showing one of the built-in size options of 10, 20, 50, and 100. Additionally, the page displays 25 items by default instead of using one of the built-in size options. (PL-40144)

  This issue has been resolved. 

- If Harness could not create the desired role because it encountered an error condition, the role creation dialog displayed an obscure message instead of a user-friendly message. For example, if you included an invalid character in the name of the role, the role creation dialog displayed the message `failed to fetch: 400` instead of a message that called your attention to the invalid character. (PL-40127, ZD-47805)

  The issue is now fixed, and the dialog shows user-friendly messages. 

#### August 4, 2023, version 80120

##### What's new

- The Universal Base Image Minimal used for the Harness user interface (both FirstGen and NextGen) and the Harness NextGen authentication service has been upgraded to ubi8-minimal:8.8. This upgrade was necessitated by version 8.7 (ubi8-minimal:8.7) reaching end of life. (PL-40095)

- Browser tabs did not show informative titles for the Settings, Delegates and FileStore pages. They showed only the generic title "Harness", making it difficult to identify the page you wanted. (PL-39923, ZD-46375)

  This issue has been fixed. Browser tabs showing those pages now have more specific titles. 

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- The YAML diff editor that shows changes to the YAML configuration associated with an event (**Account Settings** > **Audit Trail** > **Event Summary**) showed an inline diff, making it difficult for you to copy changes. (PL-40265, ZD-45911)

  The diff editor now displays a side-by-side diff from which you can copy the changes you want. 

- When you selected a project on the Projects page and then selected Pipelines, you were redirected to the page for getting started with the Continuous Integration module. (PL-40150, ZD-46389)

  This issue is now resolved. Selecting Pipelines when on the Projects page now shows you the pipelines in the selected project.

-  On the Project Connectors page, when you attempt to sort the connectors by when they were last updated, they get sorted by their connectivity status instead. (PL-40013, ZD-47483)

  This issue is resolved, and you can now sort the connectors by when they were last updated. 

- Harness NextGen could not support SMTP without authentication because the user name and password fields were required. (PL-39863, ZD-48323)

  This issue has been fixed. The user name and password fields are now optional.

- When editing a WinRM credential that referenced a secret in a different scope, the WinRM Credential wizard showed the referenced secret as undefined. This issue was caused by incorrect scope information being sent in the API request. (PL-39707)

  This issue has been fixed. The API request now includes the correct scope information.

- Instead of displaying an appropriate, RBAC-related message to users who do not have permissions to view the list of delegates, the Account Resources: Delegates page displays a "Failed to fetch: 403 Forbidden" message. (PL-39043)
  
  This issue has been fixed. Now, in this scenario, the page informs such users that they are not authorized to view the page, and it lists the permissions that they require.

- Earlier, even though you could use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to specify JVM options for the delegate, you could not override the default JVM options that Harness used, namely `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=70.0` and `-XX:MinRAMPercentage=40.0`. The option to override the defaults was unavailable because the value of JAVA_OPTS was prepended to the default JVM options. (PL-38839)
  
  This issue has been fixed. The value of JAVA_OPTS is now appended to the default JVM options, thus allowing you to override the default options.
 
  This item is available with Harness Platform version 80120 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- Delegates showed high CPU usage caused by a large number of threads that perform read operations being generated and abandoned. (PL-39797)

  This issue has been resolved through improved message read performance and an increased read timeout. 

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.08.80104. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). 

- If the delegates that were eligible to execute a pipeline task (delegates that were within the account-organization-project scope of the pipeline and matched any configured delegate selectors) did not have the required tools or connectivity to execute the task, the task timeout message included delegates that did not meet the eligibility criteria. (PL-39624, ZD-46460, ZD-46513)

  This issue has been fixed. The message displayed on task timeout has been improved for scenarios in which no delegate matches specified selectors and no delegates are found in the account.

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.08.80104. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- You were allowed to create resource groups with the same identifier as a built-in resource group. (PL-39503)
  
  This issue has been fixed. Validation in the API that creates resource groups now checks whether an existing resource group has the same identifier.

#### July 27, 2023, version 80022

##### What's new

- Earlier, when an administrator enabled the account-level two-factor authentication (2FA) setting, it affected users in the following manner:
  1. Users who had set that account as their default account received 2FA emails, and the user-level 2FA setting was enabled across all their profiles. The users were not allowed to disable the setting.
  2. Harness allowed users to modify the 2FA setting only when an administrator disabled the account-level setting subsequently. Even then, the user-level 2FA setting remained enabled, and users continued to receive a 2FA challenge until they manually disabled the user-level setting in their profiles. (PL-39507, ZD-46268)

  This behavior has been remediated. When an administrator enables the account-level 2FA setting, Harness sends the users 2FA emails but does not enable the user-level 2FA settings. Users are free to enable or disable the user-level setting in their profiles. When a user attempts to log in to their Harness account, Harness presents them with a 2FA challenge only if one or both of the settings (the account-level setting and the user-level setting) are enabled. If both settings are disabled, Harness does not present a 2FA challenge.

- If you attempt to delete a project or organization that includes resources from other Harness modules, Harness first prompts you to confirm the delete action and then prompts you to enter the name of the project or organization. This two-step procedure gives you an opportunity to consider the impact that your action might have on other modules. (PL-32376, ZD-42691)

- Delegate selection logs now include the `DelegateId`, `DelegateName`, and `hostname`. (PL-37913)
  This item is available with Harness Platform version 80022 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- You can now configure the `create_namespace` Terraform parameter to disable default namespace creation. Set the parameter to `false` in the `main.tf` file to disable namespace creation. (PL-39822, ZD-47021)
  This item is available with Harness Platform version 80022 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- API calls that requested role assignments filtered on user groups or service accounts (that is, API calls that used the `roleassignment/filter` endpoint with `principalTypeFilter` set to USER_GROUPS or SERVICE_ACCOUNTS, respectively) returned an empty body. (PL-39888, ZD-47208)

  This issue is now fixed, and you can use the API to fetch role assignments for user groups and service accounts in any scope.

- If you failed to specify the scope for a resource group that you created with the Harness API, Harness failed to apply a default scope, which it was expected to infer from the API request's query parameters. (The Harness UI, on the other hand, behaves as expected: it sets the default scope of the resource group to the scope that you are in when creating the resource group.) This behavior led to eligible users being unable to perform operations on the resource group. (PL-39271, ZD-45488)

  This issue is now fixed. If you do not specify a scope for the resource group when using the API, Harness sets the default scope correctly, and eligible users should be able to perform operations on the resource group.

- API requests to update a remote template did not update the `lastUpdateAt` field in the template. (CDS-72098)

  This issue is now fixed.

- The user interface of the approval step is inconsistent with the saved contents of the User Groups field. Sometimes, the field omits some of the previously saved user groups but shows the correct count. At other times, it lists all of the previously saved user groups but shows a lower count. (PL-39294, ZD-45548)

   This issue is now fixed.

#### July 18, 2023, version 79916

##### What's new

- The Go library has been upgraded from 1.20.4 to 1.20.5. (PL-39700)

  The upgrade fixes the following CVEs:
  - [CVE-2023-29402](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29402)
  - [CVE-2023-29405](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29405)
  - [CVE-2023-29404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29404)
  - [CVE-2023-29403](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29403)

- You can now view delegate logs when validating a connector that uses a delegate to establish connections. (PL-37919)

- Previously, when password-based authentication was used with OAuth, the functionality of auto-accepting invites was not available. Now, when Oauth is enabled for an account, invites are automatically accepted. (PL-31936, ZD-40182)

- User names cannot exceed 256 chars. (PL-21254)

- The List Tokens API now supports listing all the personal access tokens or service account tokens in the account. The API has been enhanced as follows:
1. If you have user management permissions, you can list all the personal access tokens in your account. You can also filter tokens belonging to a user or filter only active tokens.
2. If you have service account management permissions, you can list all the service account tokens in your account. You can also filter tokens for a service account or filter only active tokens. (PL-31870, ZD-40110)

This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.07.79904. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- Previously, regardless of whether your account was on Harness NextGen or Harness FirstGen, Harness sent password reset emails from Harness FirstGen. This approach failed for accounts that are only on Harness NextGen. (PL-38735)

  Now, for accounts that are only on Harness NextGen, Harness sends password reset emails from Harness NextGen.

- You could not create Azure Key Vault connectors in Harness NextGen even when you used the service principal credentials that successfully created Azure Key Vault connectors in Harness FirstGen. After you entered the service principal credentials, the Vault setup window stopped responding. After several minutes, the following message was displayed: None of the active delegates were available to complete the task. ==> : 'Missing capabilities: [https:null.vault.azure.net]' (PL-39783, ZD-46756)

  This issue is now fixed.

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.07.79904. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- The AWS connector widget's prefix field did not accept prefixes starting with a slash. Such slashes were stripped off, and this led to undesired behavior. (PL-39194, ZD-45104)

  Prefixes that begin with a slash are now supported. 

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.07.79904. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- Account-level connectors with resource groups set to **Specified** were not available at the project-level. (PL-38828, ZD-44474). 

  This issue is now fixed. The connectors list shows the connectors for which users have resource group permissions set.

  This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.07.79904. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Platform fixed issues

- SAML provider **Name** and **Friendly Name** fields allowed special characters. (PL-39070)

    This issue is fixed by `displayName` and `logoutURL` field validations. The `displayName` only allows alphanumeric characters, `_`, `-`, `.`, and spaces. The `logoutURL` must be a valid HTTPS URL format. 

- When creating a service account with the same name in a different scope, an error was thrown. (PL-38885)

  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- When **ALL** scope was selected on the **Role binding** page for a specific user, incorrect data was displayed. (PL-38426, ZD-43503)

  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- Deletion of vault connectors does not delete the corresponding perpetual tasks. (PL-27621)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- Account-level connectors with resource groups set to **Specified** were not available at the project-level. (PL-38828)

   This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.06.79707. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- The account-level **Session Timeout (in minutes)** allowed values greater than the 4320 minute maximum. (PL-32498)

   This issue has been resolved by adding a code validation. The field no longer accepts values above 4320 minutes.

   This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.06.79707. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

#### June 19, 2023, version 79606

##### Platform new features

- In earlier releases, users were allowed to include the following special characters in the user name field in their profile: colon (`:`), slash (`/`), less than sign (`<`), greater than sign (`>`), equal sign (`=`), and parentheses (`(` and `)`). Support for these special characters allowed malicious users to inject HTML and JavaScript code into deployment-related emails such as approval emails. (PL-39099)

  For enhanced security, Harness no longer allows a user to include these special characters in their name. If an existing user name has any of these special characters, Harness does not include the special characters when adding the name to emails.

- Free and Community accounts are now limited to 100 connectors. (PL-32654)

- The dialog for adding an encrypted text secret now includes an option to test a referenced secret. (PL-31083) 

- The dialog that enables you to select a connector did not list connectors in any order. (PL-27568)

  This release adds a menu that you can use to sort the listed connectors in various ways (for example, by name or by date).

- In earlier releases, you could change the Git branch only in Pipeline Studio. (CDS-68007)

  Starting with this release, you can also change the branch in the dialog for running a pipeline. You can also run the pipeline from any branch directly from the pipeline listing page. 

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Platform fixed issues

- Certain users see the following message when they select the Connectors page for their project: "You are not authorized to view default settings.
You are missing the following permission: "View default settings" in Account scope." (PL-39221, ZD-45360)

  This issue has been fixed by the removal of an account-level permission check that has been deemed unnecessary.

- SCIM PATCH requests for deleting a Harness user return a “user does not exist” message in a successful delete operation. (PL-38868, ZD-44150)

  This issue has been resolved by returning a NULL response in the Patch operation to delete a user.

- In earlier releases, the button for managing role bindings for users, user groups, and service accounts was named +Role. However, given that you can also remove role bindings in the Manage Role Bindings dialog, the button has been renamed to Manage Roles. (PL-28484)

- Improved randomness when there are multiple eligible delegates with no tasks running to avoid selecting the same delegate each time. (PL-39219)

  This item is available with Harness Platform version 79606 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

##### Early access

- Harness now populates `givenName` and `familyName` for users via SCIM and returns the same when a GET, CREATE, or UPDATE request is made. (PL-31498)

  This is behind the feature flag `PL_NEW_SCIM_STANDARDS`.

- The response of a CRUD operation on a user or user group now contains the following meta fields as per the SCIM 2.0 standards:

  - createdAt

  - lastUpdated

  - version

  - resourceType (PL-31497)
  
    This is behind the feature flag `PL_NEW_SCIM_STANDARDS`.

- Accessing the CD module redirects you to one of the following: 

  - Get Started: If you don't have any pipelines in your project.

  - Deployment list page: This is the default selection page. (PIE-7625)

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.


##### Fixed issues

- The **Remove** option is disabled for the first user added to a user group through SCIM. A code check prevents the deletion of a user from a user group if the user is externally managed. (PL-31125, ZD-39358)

  ![](./static/remove-scim-user-issue.png)

  This issue has now been resolved and users can now remove any user from a user group created through the Harness UI.

- Deletion of externally managed users from organizations and projects is disabled. (PL-31104, ZD-39109,39110)

- The project selector component selects multiple projects with the same project name across different organization IDs.(PL-30663)
  
  The project selection code has been enhanced to select projects corresponding to specific organization IDs.

- The error message displayed when creating the GitHub connector and selecting **Harness Platform** as the connectivity option is not clear and informative. (PL-29953)
  
  Modifying the error message to indicate that the secret manager being used is not Harness' built-in secret manager fixed the problem.

#### January 10, 2023, version 78105

Delegate version: 23.01.78100

##### Important announcements

**Update repository references to the NextGen Helm delegate** 

The location of the repository that contains the NextGen Helm chart is changing. Change your references to the repository location from [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/) to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/). Updates to the chart will not be made to the deprecated repository.

**The following role-assignments are removed for all the existing users across all the accounts:**(PL-28848)

  - **Account Viewer - All Account Level Resources**: This was a role-assignment within the account scope and has been removed for all the users.
  This does not apply in the following scenarios: 
    - If an account has enabled the feature flag `ACCOUNT_BASIC_ROLE_ONLY`.
    - If an account does not have the **Account Viewer - All Account Level Resources** role-assignment for the built-in user group `All Account Users`.
- **Organization Viewer - All Organization Level Resources**: This was a role-assignment within the organization scope and has been removed for all the users.
- **Project Viewer - All Project Level Resources**: This was a role-assignment within the project scope and has been removed for all the users.

For more information, see [Built-in user groups](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups#built-in-user-groups)


##### What's new

- Secrets and connectors now have a character limit of 128 for the **Name** and **ID** fields. (PL-29887)
  
- The [Role-Assignments](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Role-Assignments/#operation/getFilteredRoleAssignmentByScopeList) API now fetches role assignments by scope. 
(PL-29496, ZD-36050)
  This helps you keep a track of the role assignments within a specific scope.

- The repository location of the Helm chart for the NextGen delegate is changing. (DEL-5576) 

  The repository is being deprecated. Updates to the chart will not be made to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/) and will not be available from that location. To ensure retrieval of the most recent Helm chart, update your repository references to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/).

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues
- Inline selection does not display connectors and secrets according to their scope. (PL-30655)
  
  An enhancement in the pre-select logic has fixed this issue.

- In spite of selecting **Start TLS** in the UI, the SMTP configuration does not support StartTLS. (PL-30574)

  A code enhancement has resolved this issue.

- The Get Resource Group API returns an HTTP 200 response code when an entity is missing. (PL-30236)

  This has been fixed, and the API now returns an HTTP 404 response code if an entity is missing.

- Editing a connector through connector selection does not automatically select it. (PL-28175)

  Enhancing the connector selection component logic to pre-select the connector in the list if it is in edit mode fixed this issue.

- Unauthorized user login to a Harness account displays a white label error. This happens when the account has SAML enabled with restricted email domain access.(PL-15022)
  
  This has been fixed by displaying appropriate error message.

- The date format in Pipeline Studio is incorrect. (PIE-7040)

  Changing the date format to `DD/MM/YYYY` has fixed this issue.

- Input sets with expression set fields does not support autocomplete. (PIE-6990)

  The addition of pipeline variables context provider to the input set form has fixed this issue.

- A hover over the stage does not display the condition details for skipping the stage. (PIE-6987)

  A correction to the path used to collect the details has fixed this issue.
  
  -   Changed how the NextGen Docker delegate is identified in the delegate section log. The Docker delegate is now identified by the delegate ID, which is the concatenation of `delegateName` and `delegateHostName`. This replaces the use of the delegate name (`delegateHostName`), which was usually the `containerId` value. (DEL-5280) 

- Changed the behavior of the delegate dropdown menu. The UI core library was updated to add a parameter that prevents the reset of expanded states when new data loads in a table. This resolved an issue with the dropdown menu collapsing automatically. (DEL-5541)

- Fixed a problem that was causing the `kryo` component to fail. The problem was caused when nested `java.lang.RuntimeException` errors occurred during manager response. (DEL-5609)

#### December 22, 2022, version 77908

Delegate version: 22.12.77802

##### What's new

-   API support for discovery of SCIM service provider features and schema. (PL-29069)
    
    Harness now supports the following three HTTP GET API endpoints to facilitate the discovery of SCIM service provider features and schema. These endpoints are defined in SCIM 2.0:

    -   ServiceProviderConfig

    -   ResourceType

    -   Schemas

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

-   Changed how the delegate handles secrets. Multiline secrets are now detected and masked appropriately. (DEL-5510)
 
-   Changed the display of delegate version information in Harness Manager to exclude minimum version information for delegates that are not connected. (DEL-5523)

-   The Create Resource Group API returns an HTTP 500 response code when the included scopes are blank. (PL-30195, ZD-37663)

    This has been fixed by adding a null check and throwing a null pointer exception when the included scopes are left blank.

-   Editing a connector through connector selection does not automatically select it. (PL-28175)

    Enhancing the connector selection component logic to pre-select the connector in the list if it is in edit mode fixed this issue.
    
-   Entering an invalid value for `tenant_id` does not throw any error and allows selection of previously loaded vaults in Azure Key Vault secret manager. (PL-28136)
    
    Displaying an appropriate error message and setting the vault value to empty when there is an error in fetching vaults has fixed this issue.

-   Searching for email addresses to add users to user groups does not show any results. (PL-27797)
    
    Changing the filter logic to search using the email address as well as the user name has fixed this issue.

-   The date format in Pipeline Studio is incorrect. (PIE-7040)

    Changing the date format to `DD/MM/YYYY` has fixed this issue.

-   Retrying a failed pipeline does not populate the start pipeline dialog with the input values from the previous execution. (PIE-6780, ZD-37648)
    
    Resetting the input set form with values from Formik has fixed this issue.

-   If the environment details are blank in the deploy stage settings, clicking the Service tab throws an error. (PIE-6240)
    
    Adding backward compatibility for the tabs has fixed this issue.


#### December 13, 2022, version 77808

##### What's new

- You can now refer to existing secrets of Azure Key Vault, AWS secret manager, and GCP secret manager. (PL-29915)

  With this enhancement, you need not create secrets in Harness. You can use expressions to reference the secrets already existing in the mentioned secrets managers. For more information, see [Reference Existing Secret Managers Secrets](/docs/first-gen/firstgen-platform/security/secrets-management/reference-existing-secrets/).

- You can now use the Git client to commit changes while creating or updating pipelines using Bitbucket on-prem as the Git provider. (PIE-6423)

  To do this, enable Use Git client for commits in the default settings at the account scope. Harness checks out the code on the delegate and uses the Git client to make the commits to your Git repository.

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

- Executing a pipeline with multiple states causes issues and results in incomplete execution. (PIE-6893)

  This happens when one of the steps of the pipeline deploys a single service to multiple environments with GitOps.

  An enhancement in the logic has fixed this issue and the pipeline now executes completely.

- When running a preflight check with an empty field in input sets, the error message displays incorrectly. (PIE-5788)

  A correction to the error message has fixed this issue.

#### December 7, 2022, version 77716

Delegate: 77800

##### What's new

- Securing data through JSON Web Token (JWT) masking. (PL-29019, ZD-32004)

  Harness now masks all JWTs in pipelines and delegate logs. This change prevents data leakage risks for the applications running in Harness.

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

- Provisioning users through SCIM using Okta throws an error. This happens when a user is first staged in Okta and then activated with the Harness app. The GET API for SCIM does not return any result although the user exists in the Harness database. (PL-29702, ZD-36753)

  An enhancement in the fetch logic for the GET API has fixed this issue.

- The DELETE API for Harness entities does not throw an error when the entity identifier is invalid. The API response code is 200 and the data field in the response is False. (PL-27270)

  The API now returns an HTTP 404 response code and an appropriate error message.

- The drag-drop feature for nodes on the create node settings does not work. (PIE-6575)

  Adding event logic for improved handling of drag-and-drop actions on nodes has fixed the issue. You can now drag-drop a node on a new as well as existing node.

- The authorization header in the log streaming request is missing Bearer before the token. This issue causes log streaming to fail. (PIE-6554)

  Changing the signature of the authorization header to Authorization: Bearer `<token>` has fixed this issue.

- Clicking All Events when creating a notification for a pipeline does not select all the events. (PIE-6524)

  Selecting all the pipeline events on clicking All Events has fixed this issue. Now the All Events field also has an additional state indeterminate associated with it. The state indicates if all the pipeline events are neither included nor excluded for notifications.

- The HTML parsing for pipeline logs takes longer than expected and delays the display of the logs. (PIE-6538)

  An enhancement in the parsing technique and the introduction of caching has fixed this issue.

- When creating a pipeline, stage, or step, you are allowed to use the $ sign in the name or identifier even though the $ sign is invalid in those strings. (PIE-6078)

  A modification to the regex to remove the support for the $ sign has fixed this issue.

#### November 29, 2022, version 77608

Delegate: 77431

##### What's new

**Platform**

- Fix to help you identify Harness in your two-factor authentication app. (PL-29563)

  The default name of the entry for Harness in two-factor authentication (2FA) apps such as Google Authenticator now begins with Harness\_. This change enables you to identify the correct entry, and to therefore use the correct code, for authenticating to Harness. If you configured 2FA for Harness before this change, remove the existing entry and reconfigure 2FA to see the new name.

- Direct use of email addresses in v2 APIs for creating and updating user groups. (PL-29018)

  You can now use email addresses in v2 APIs for creating or updating a user group. It is no longer required to first fetch the email addresses by using user IDs

- You can now create user groups inline when setting up the Approval stage in a pipeline. (PL-28022)

  This is helpful when the user group that needs to be sent notifications does not already exist. The scope of the user group is within the project corresponding to the pipeline.

- The Harness UI now lists the versions of services in your account settings. To see the versions, go to Account Settings > Overview, and then expand Platform Service Versions. (PL-26581)

  Approval messages in Harness approvals can now have expressions in multiple lines. (PIE-6238, ZD-36667,37069)

- Harness service variables now support dots (.). (PIE-4613)

  This is helpful when you have JSON/YAML files where you want to update the keys with some values. You can define variables for those keys in harness with (.) to access the keys. The expression to access a key would be:
  <+variables.get("example.key")>

- You can now drag the step details section and move it to the desired location. (PIE-3890)

- You need not enter the Tags or Description while importing an entity from Git. (PIE-6171)

  The corresponding information for these fields are fetched from Git.

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- Adopted the use of an immutable image for the delegate that is installed by default in newly created accounts. For more information on new delegate features including auto-update, see Delegate
  Overview. (DEL-4888)

- When provisioning users through SCIM, users receive two emails: one from FirstGen and the other from NextGen. (PL-29896)

  This happens when the account has two-factor authentication enabled and the authentication mechanism is SAML with SCIM. This has now been fixed to send a single email to the provisioned users.

- Referencing multiple secrets by using the dynamic secret expression for HashiCorp Vault causes issues. The value of the latest decrypted secret replaces the values of any previously decrypted secret. (PL-29554, ZD-36459)

  This has now been fixed and the secrets have the corresponding decrypted values.

- The list of environment groups does not appear in the runtime input settings. (PIE-6411)

  This has now been fixed and the list of environment groups is available in the runtime input settings.

- When the length of a variable expression is more than 2048 characters in a pipeline, saving the pipeline takes longer than expected. (PIE-6291, ZD-36820)

  Simplifying the regex for the variable value expressions has now fixed this.

- Clicking Run in pipeline studio navigates to the input sets section in Run Pipeline window. This happens even when you have no runtime inputs for a Pipeline.(PIE-6264).

  This has now been fixed. If a pipeline does not need any runtime inputs, clicking on Run starts the pipeline execution.

- Service V2 does not resolve the infrastructure definition parameters passed from the triggers. (PIE-6155, ZD-36720)

  When a trigger invokes a pipeline, the YAML definition of the trigger and the corresponding pipeline with runtime inputs are merged. In YAML files with a single node element, the infrastructure definition is not processed on the triggers and is not passed as a runtime value.

  This has now been fixed. The YAML processing on triggers now takes care of processing the single node elements and propagates the value to the respective pipeline.

- The frequency of polling to fetch the pipeline execution list is 20 seconds. Such a long polling interval means that the data fetched by one poll goes stale before the next poll. (PIE-6151)

  This has now been fixed by increasing the polling frequency to every 5 seconds.

- The Save as New Input Set settings does not close after you save the details. (PIE-5708)

  This issue occurs when you run a pipeline that requires runtime input sets. This has now been fixed and the Save as New Input Set settings close after you save the details.

- Selecting an event as Merge Request, the default selection for Build Type is not correct for GitLab webhook triggers.(PIE-5117)
  This has now been fixed by changing the default selection for Build Type to Git Pull Request for the Merge Request event.

##### Fixed issues

**Custom Dashboards**

- A bug causing some Dashboards to be displayed incorrectly based on their Feature Flags has been fixed. Dashboards are now correctly shown or hidden by their corresponding Feature Flags. (CDB-390)

- Users previously were able to only clone Dashboards either from the "Out Of The Box" Dashboards, or from folders where they had an EDIT permission assigned. Now, if the user has any folder in which they have the EDIT permission assigned, they can clone any available Dashboard into that folder. (CDB-415)

Dashboard alerts and schedules will now run at the specified time in the users local timezone. (CDB-434)

**Platform**

- Fixed critical vulnerability CVE-2022-42889 in the delegate image.

- Introduced vertical scaling capabilities for non-legacy delegates. The Xmx flag that specifies the maximum memory allocation for the Java process is set to 70% of the container allotment. (DEL-5150)

- Enhanced the information on delegate creation and listing in the delegate installation pages. (DEL-5098)

- When clicking Save in the Default settings, error messages do not appear for the radio buttons and checkboxes. (PL-29489)

  Introducing formik fields and external error message components for the non-formik fields has fixed this issue.

- Harness Audit Logs API is returning an incorrect error for an expired token. (PL-29425, ZD-36045)

  The API response now returns the correct error when the API token is invalid or expired.

- User Invite Auto Accept is not working when Oauth is enabled and the feature flag AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES is enabled. (PL-28807)

  Removing the SAML condition for Auto Invite Accept has fixed this issue.

- Re-run Pipeline is not working as expected. (PIE-6134)

  This issue has now been fixed by checking if the values of the variables are missing from the variables map.

- When running the pipeline, the primary artifact source is not auto-selected and tags and buckets are not fetched. (PIE-6084)

  This issue has now been fixed.

- When clicking outside the step settings, there is no option to Apply Changes or Cancel. (PIE-4428)

  This issue has now been fixed.

#### November 6, 2022, version 77317

**Platform**

You can now get optimized performance on remote pipelines if you are on delegate version 772xx or higher,
by enabling the feature flag USE_GET_FILE_V2_GIT_CALL . (PL-29459)

If you are on an older delegate version, you can upgrade your delegate and then enable the feature flag for optimized performance.

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- The scope of a newly created connector in the account scope was incorrect. When a user tried to use a connector in the account scope, the project scope was displayed. (PL-29190)

  This has now been fixed to pick the scope information from the connector data.

- On clicking Import Template in Templates, the title of the settings was Import Templates from Git. (PL-29094)

  The title of the settings is now Import Template from Git.

- Users were receiving two 2FA emails when the feature flags AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES and PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES were enabled. (PL-29081)

  This has now been fixed to restrict notifications with 2FA QR code emails to just one.

- Editing secrets in Azure Key Vault with minimum permissions was failing. (PL-29025)

- The Default Settings in the project scope displayed side navigation options for the account scope. (PL-28977)

  Harness now displays the scope-specific side navigation options while on the Default Settings.

- Audit logs were not generated when the authentication mechanism was changed. (PL-28680)

  No audit logs were available when the authentication mechanism was changed from:

  - SAML to LDAP and vice versa

  - User name and password to OAuth and vice versa

  This has now been fixed so that Audit logs are available for changes in the authentication mechanism.

- On creating a connector inline in the Pipeline studio, the connector was not listed in the connectors list and was not selected by default. (PL-27819)

  This has now been fixed so that the connector list refreshes and selects the inline connector by default.

- While editing a connector in the account scope, users were able to select secrets at the organization and project scope. (PL-25825)

  This has now been fixed to display secrets in the parent scope while editing a connector.

- The user was able to delete a Secret Manager in Harness after disabling the Harness Secret Manager. (PL-23148)

  Harness now checks if there is at least one active secret manager before deleting a secret manager while the Harness Secret Manager is disabled.

- On the secret details page, there was no option to delete the secret. (PL-15045)

  This has now been fixed to provide options to edit and delete a secret from the secret details page.

- In the Pipelines, when the commit message was left blank, the Pipeline Execution History threw an exception. (PIE-6017)

  This has now been fixed so that the Pipeline Execution History displays execution details.

- The Run pipeline YAML with K8s Apply step was incorrect when the input set data was undefined. (PIE-5998)

  This has now been fixed to pick the input set data from the parent component. Also, all fields path are now updated at runtime.

- In a Pipeline with input sets, the specified delegates were ignored while merging the input sets. (PIE-5879, ZD-35813)

  This has now been fixed to pick the delegates corresponding to the delegate selectors.

- In Pipeline Triggers, deleting variables from the YAML caused inconsistent behavior. (PIE-5737, ZD-35537)

  This has now been fixed to enable the deletion of variables from the YAML by fetching the base values from the Templates.

- The display of detail information for immutable delegates version 76300 and earlier was changed to indicate that autoUpgrade is OFF. These delegate versions do not include the autoUpgrade feature. (DEL-5096)

- Editing secrets in Azure Key Vault with minimum permissions was failing. (PL-29025)

- Some fields were missing in the GET Pipeline CRUD endpoint. (PL-28918)

- The status code for GET API was incorrect when the role assignments were absent. (PL-28779)

- When 2FA was enabled in the Account scope, the user invitation emails did not contain a 2FA token. (PL-28549)

- The conditional skip option in the Pipeline Studio was not displayed consistently across various browsers. (PIE-5712)

  This is fixed by making the skip icon SVG as

#### October 18, 2022, version 77116

Delegate version: 22.10.77021

##### What's new

**Platform**

The functionality of the delegate auto-upgrade components was enhanced. On installation, the AutoUpgrade feature displays a status message of Synchronizing. If the feature does not receive an API call from the upgrade within 90 minutes, the status message changes to OFF. This affects delegates that are installed with the upgrader components.

A loader is now displayed on click of Run Pipeline to indicate that the Pipeline is running. (PIE-5396)

##### Early access

N/A

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- No precedence was set when the auth mechanism was username and password and the feature flag PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES was enabled. (PL-28739)

  This is now fixed by adding a check to ensure the auth mechanism of username and password takes precedence.

- Deleting a Project was not deleting the referenced secrets. (PL-28613)

  This is fixed by deleting the secrets corresponding to a deleted Project.

- The repo name was null in the file path URL for Bitbucket On-Prem account level connector. (PL-28533)

- The hard delete for environment was not working as expected. (PL-28403, ZD-34833,35135)

- The audit trail displayed for vault \_authTokenRef secrets was not correct. (PL-26764, ZD-32596)

  This is fixed by not storing any dummy secret if the feature flag DO_NOT_RENEW_APPROLE_TOKEN is enabled for the vault app role.

- User was not able to edit the barrier name in the Pipeline's flow control section. (PIE-5621)

#### October 7, 2022, version 77025

**Platform**

- The INIT_SCRIPT was changed to correct an issue that changed behavior. The issue was triggered with the use of the set -e command. (DEL-4898, ZD-34654)

- The Default value column is not yet available to users, but the column was added to the user interface. (PL-28215)

  Now, the Default value column is removed from the Variables list page since you can't provide a default value.​

- The field Variable on the Accounts and Organization pages wasn't consistent with the rest of the pages. (PL-28214)​

  The issue is fixed by removing the Validation text in the Variables form and replacing it with a simple text box and a tooltip that specifies 'Only Fixed Values' are supported in Scope Variables.​

- The error message displayed by GCP KMS was generic and not useful. (PL-28103)​

  Now, the error message displays details such as the error code, reason, etc., that would aid in resolving the issue causing the error.​

- When you enter invalid credentials, the Microsoft Azure Vault client authentication exception was logged, but not considered as an error, and proceeded to the next step where the execution failed. (PL-28017)​

  Now, this issue is fixed. The exception is logged as an error and doesn't proceed further.​

  The error message displayed when a Microsoft Azure Vault encryption failed was generic and not meaningful.​

  Now, the error message displays details such as the error code, account ID, secret name, etc., that would aid in resolving the issue causing the error.​​

#### September 22, 2022, version 76817

##### What's new

**Platform**

- Harness Manager was changed to remove the edit and details UI for Immutable Delegates. These Delegates cannot be changed. (DEL-4756)

- A migration will run to remove the following role bindings directly assigned to users for accounts having ACCOUNT_BASIC_ROLE turned ON (PL-28284):

  - At Account Scope, Account Basic/Account Viewer -All Account Resources​.
  - At Organization scope, Organization Viewer - All Organization Resources.​
  - At Project Scope, Project Viewer - All Project Resources.​

  Harness now has a [built-in user group](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups#built-in-user-groups) at each scope. These groups have all the users at the respective scope as their members. As a part of this change, Harness will stop assigning any roles to the User Groups by default.​ Users can assign roles to the built-in User Group at a specific scope, which becomes the default role for all the users in that group. (PL-26145)

**Platform**

- The Vault Renewal Perpetual Task corresponding to a deleted Vault Secret Manager was not getting deleted. (PL-27952)

- First Gen login Audit Events were being captured in Next Gen Audit Trail. (PL-22435, ZD-26366)

- Create via YAML Builder did not have a cancel option. (PL-20197)

- Git Management options were not displayed for Feature Flags. (PIE-5292)

  This was because it was using a Project level flag that was replaced. This is now fixed by using the replaced flag.

- The links for information on Looping Strategies was redirecting to incorrect docs. (PIE-5266, ZD-34311)

  This is fixed by updating the appropriate doc links.

**Pipelines**

- Git Management option was not available for Feature Flags. (PIE-5292)

- The link to the Looping Strategies doc was not correct. (PIE-5266, ZD-34311)

- Errors were encountered while executing a Pipeline after saving Input Sets to a new branch. (PIE-4981)
  This is fixed by by disabling the Commit to a new branch option for Input Sets.

##### Important Announcements

**Platform**

Harness now has a [built-in user group](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups#built-in-user-groups) at each scope. These groups have all the users at the respective scope as their members.

As a part of this change, Harness will stop assigning any roles to the User Groups by default.

Users can assign roles to the built-in user group at a specific scope, which becomes the default role for all the users in that group.

#### September 7, 2022, version 76619

##### What's new

- You can now inherit User Groups created at a higher scope by using Assign Roles. (PL-27237)

  See [Create groups by inheritance](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups#create-groups-by-inheritance).

- You can now view the past 10 executions of the Pipelines and sort them from the table. You can also go to a specific execution by clicking on it. (PIE-4903)

##### Early access

  You can onboard any secret manager with Harness and reference their secrets in Harness using a Shell Script.

  This is behind the feature flag CUSTOM_SECRET_MANAGER_NG.

See [Add a Custom Secret Manager](/docs/platform/Secrets/Secrets-Management/custom-secret-manager).

##### Fixed issues

- Fixed the display of an error message in the UI. The error message was not properly displayed when a pipeline selector was added using invalid characters. (DEL-4755)

- The Description of User Groups in Access Control was not wrapped and was resulting in inconsistent UI. (PL-27733, ZD-34043)

- Error was thrown when importing a Pipeline from Git which was already in use. (PL-27598)

  This is fixed now by displaying a confirmation message.

- Pipeline was not being triggered while setting up a trigger for a Bitbucket repo. (PIE-4827, ZD-33190)

  This is fixed by fixing the order of commit hashes being passed from delegate to SCM service.

##### What's new

- Git Experience in Next Gen is now enhanced and simplified. (PL-26339)

  See [Git Experience](/docs/category/git-experience/).

- You can now switch branches directly from the Pipeline execution history. This will make it easier to switch branches straight from execution history rather than going to the Pipeline studio first and then returning to execution history. (PIE-4985)

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

- Email notification for approval was not to SCIM groups with "\_" in the group name. (PL-26457)

- Multiple error toasts occurred when there was network failure because the error toast condition was at the component level, hence getting re-rendered every time. (PIE-5019)

- Users without appropriate permissions were able to create Pipeline and add Stage and Steps. (PIE-5008)

  The Add Stage and Add Step options are now hidden for users with View permission.

- The existing Input Sets were not getting updated. (PIE-4855)
  To fix this, Save as Input Set is changed to Save as New Input Set to indicate the correct behaviour.

#### August 25th, 2022, version 76425

##### Fixed issues

- Error messages were not displayed while creating a HashCorp Vault Connector. (PL-27383​)

  This was happening for App Role based login because the value of the namespace was not sent as part of the vault config.

  As a part of this fix, the namespace value is now added.

- Errors were blocking users from creating a secret even after clicking the back button and updating the correct values. (PL-26169​)

  This is now fixed by sending the updated data when the back button is clicked.

- Unsaved changes were retained even after clicking Discard in the Pipeline Studio. (PIE-4880​)

- The loading indicator was not displayed when filters were applied. (PIE-4829​)

  The resource constraint endpoint returned an empty response when the Pipeline Service threw an exception.

  Now the case is handled and the response is returned as expected. (PIE-4727)​

- Improved NextGen secret cache to store encryption Details​ (DEL-4288)

  The Secret cache in NextGen has been revamped to store Encryption details. These details are being fetched from NextGen manager via rest API calls from the FirstGen manager, which increases latency during task queuing. With this cache, we will substantially reduce this latency.​

- Hard Delete Delegates and linked entities when their parent Project or Organization is deleted​ (DEL-4202)

  Delegate entities will be hard deleted on deleting parent Org/Project. Users will be able to recreate these entities with the same identifier.​

- Remove OVERRIDE_CONNECTOR_SELECTOR​ (DEL-4159)
